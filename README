This android app is a tip calculator which also has new relic so it will also send data to New Relic and rollbar 

to Send errors to your Rollbar project edit the app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and add your token

The error is in the mainactivity.java file look for the resetBill() method to see how the error is generated 

Additional file you may need to edit is the build.gradle file (under dependencies) if there are any changes 
to make when you create an Android Studio project in the Rollbar project SDK wizard
